Mutation can occur if during replication, a mistake is made in copying the RNA or DNA of a viral particle. Some types of viruses can also swap genetic material with nearby viral particles, a process called recombination.  Sometimes a mutation \"breaks\" a virus, and makes it unable to reproduce in which case the lineage of virus with that mutation will die off. Sometimes a mutation \"improves\" a virus, and makes it better and spreading or reproducing, in which case the mutation will probably stick around. Sometimes, mutations don't improve or break a virus and are just the result of random events.\n","\n","Here is an example of how the influenza virus has mutated/evolved in the last 100 years!\n","![](https://live.staticflickr.com/7155/6830073073_9f847b8273_z.jpg)\n","\n","\n","Over time, what started as a virus with one unique genome, may mutate into several different strains of virus.

Different variants have been discovered so far, including the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and P.1 (Gamma) variants. These variants might flip certain nucleobases (A, U, C or G) to change the behavior of their spike proteins, or drop nucleobases in certain spots, referred to as a *deletion*.
